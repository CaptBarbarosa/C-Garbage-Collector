# Garbage Collector in C

Welcome to my Garbage Collector in C repository! In this project, I've developed a C tool that automates the garbage collection process, making memory management smoother.

## About Garbage Collection

When we refer to the heap in programming, we're essentially talking about allocated memory. In the C language, traditionally, the responsibility of garbage collection falls on the userâ€”that's you! It's your job to free up memory to prevent potential memory leaks.

While there are powerful external tools like `valgrind` for detecting memory leaks and established solutions like the Boehm garbage collector for automated garbage collection, the thrill of creating your own tool cannot be understated.

## Why Build Your Own Garbage Collector?

Sure, existing tools get the job done, but where's the fun in that? Writing your own garbage collector allows you to tailor it to your specific needs and challenges, providing a deeper understanding of memory management in the process.

## Acknowledgments

This project wouldn't have been possible without the valuable insights from various Stack Overflow answers. Additionally, credit goes to a Udemy course titled "Design and Implementation of Java-like Garbage Collector for C Programs," which served as a guiding light throughout the development journey.

Feel free to explore the code, contribute, and let's make garbage collection in C an even more enjoyable experience!
